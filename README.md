# 🎸 Random Band Name Generator

A fun and interactive Python program that generates a **random band name** based on your input and a bit of randomness!

---

## 💡 What It Does

This program prompts the user for a series of fun and creative words (like an adjective, a plural noun, a color, etc.), and then combines those with a randomly selected pattern to generate a unique and quirky **band name**.

Each time you run it, you could get a completely different name — from _"Lowtempo Pancakes Tigers"_ to _"Alex and the Suns"_ or _"Red, Robots"_.
